# Assignment 2 - Classes, Generalization, and Interfaces

## Overview

In this assignment, you will dive into object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, generalization (inheritance), and interfaces in C#.
You will create a program that demonstrates your understanding of these concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create a Base Class

1. Create a base class named `Shape`.
2. Add properties and methods to the `Shape` class that are common to all shapes. These could include properties like `Area` and `Perimeter`.

### Task 2: Create Specialized Classes

1. Create at least two derived classes that inherit from the `Shape` class. Examples of shapes could be `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
2. Each derived class should have its properties and methods specific to that shape. For example, a `Circle` might have a `Radius` property, and a `Rectangle` might have `Width` and `Height` properties.

### Task 3: Implement Interfaces

1. Create one or more interfaces related to shapes. For example, you could have an `IShape` interface with methods like `CalculateArea` and `CalculatePerimeter`.
2. Implement these interfaces in your derived classes.

### Task 4: Use the Classes

1. In your `Main` method or a separate program, create instances of your shapes (e.g., circles and rectangles).
2. Demonstrate how you can use the properties and methods of the base class and derived classes.
